<p>In July 2013, the movement began with the use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag">hashtag</a>&nbsp;#BlackLivesMatter on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">social media</a>&nbsp;after&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_George_Zimmerman">the acquittal</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Zimmerman">George Zimmerman</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Trayvon_Martin">the shooting death</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American">African-American</a>&nbsp;teen&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin">Trayvon Martin</a>&nbsp;17 months earlier in February 2012.

<p>Rehabilitation is defined as “<strong><em>a set of interventions designed to optimize functioning and reduce disability in individuals with health conditions in interaction with their environment</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Put simply, rehabilitation helps a child, adult or older person to be as independent as possible in everyday activities and enables participation in education, work, recreation and meaningful life roles such as taking care of family. It does so by addressing underlying conditions (such as pain) and improving the way an individual functions in everyday life, supporting them to overcome difficulties with thinking, seeing, hearing, communicating, eating or moving around.</p>



<p>Anybody may need rehabilitation at some point in their lives, following an injury, surgery, disease or illness, or because their functioning has declined with age.</p>



<p>Some examples of rehabilitation include:</p>



<ul><li>Exercises to improve a person’s speech, language and communication after a brain injury.</li><li>Modifying an older person’s home environment to improve their safety and independence at home and to reduce their risk of falls.</li><li>Exercise training and education on healthy living for a person with a heart disease.</li><li>Making, fitting and educating an individual to use a prosthesis after a leg amputation.</li><li>Positioning and splinting techniques to assist with skin healing, reduce swelling, and to regain movement after burn surgery.</li><li>Prescribing medicine to reduce muscle stiffness for a child with cerebral palsy.</li><li>Psychological support for a person with depression.</li><li>Training in the use of a white cane, for a person with vision loss.</li></ul>



<p>Rehabilitation is highly person-centered, meaning that the interventions and approach selected for each individual depends on their goals and preferences. Rehabilitation can be provided in many different settings, from inpatient or outpatient hospital settings, to private clinics, or community settings such as an individual’s home.</p>



<p>The rehabilitation workforce is made up of different health workers, including but not limited to physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and audiologists, orthotists and prosthetists, clinical psychologists, physical medicine&nbsp;and&nbsp;rehabilitation doctors,&nbsp;and rehabilitation nurses.</p>

<p>Child labour is a service rendered by children in any field during their childhood. This is done due to lack of resources for survival, irresponsibility of the parents or lack of resources by the owner to increase their returns on low investment.</p>



<p>Childhood is the greatest and happiest period of everyone’s life, during which one learns about the basic strategy of life from parents, loved ones and nature.</p>



<p>Child labour interferes with the proper growth and development of children in all aspects, mentally, physically, socially and intellectually.</p>



<p>Childhood is the birthright of everyone, which he should live under the love and care of his parents, but this illegal act of child labour forces a child to live life like a grown-up.</p>



<p>This causes a lack of many important things in the child’s life such as improper physical growth and development, improper development of mind, socially and intellectually unhealthy.</p>



<p>Child labour keeps a child away from all the benefits of childhood, the happiest and memorable period of all life is spent working.</p>
